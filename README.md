# Advent of Code

Allright, it's that time of the year again! ‚≠ê

This repository holds my [Python][python-url] code for the [Advent of Code][aoc-url] üéÑ.

I strongly recommend to solve the puzzles yourself first, and then look for the solution (here on GitHub, or in the [subreddit][aoc-reddit-url]) to compare.

Please keep in mind that this code is written for fun and to get the job done in a (relatively) short amount of time.
Nevertheless I try to avoid brute-force solutions and optimize code quality as far as reasonnably possible.

## Included years

_I try as much as possible to complete the puzzles each day of AoC._
_At some point, I will eventually lose the motivation, or just not have the time, and don't feel like solving the puzzles afterwards._
_As a result, I did not complete a full AoC event up to now._
